### Problem we are sloving:

- Whenever we try to learn a new technology we come across a lot of errors and  we cannot find what's going wrong. Most of the times we waste our time in searching for a working soluiton on StackoverFlow or Googling our doubts. NOW CHATGPT is the new crazeee....
- BUT BUT... oftenly we cannot find the optimised or easily understandable code on the net. EVEN CHAT GPT fails here...  
- Issues before PRs. If you plan to make a contribution, please make sure there is an issue for it. You can either find an existing issue or open a new issue if none exists.


### How CodeHelp helps you in this situation?

CodeHelp is a 1-to-1 tutoring platform, where you can just upload your doubt and you get assisted  by a technical expert of that particular tech you are learning or you have doubt in.
You just have to upload your doubt in the ASK DOUBT page, add in the details, select the relevant techstack and that's it. You get automatically to the expert tutors within minutes and solve  your doubts so easily and also understand your mistake more deeply.

## How we BUILT this?

Our main focus was to build a video call connection between learner and tutor, 

#### Techstack used: 
<p > SOCKET-IO, AWS, WEBRTC, AGORA, REACTJS, NODEJS, MONGODB, TAILWINDCSS, EXPRESS, RAZORPAY PAYMENT </p> 

## Challenges we ran into?
The first big challenge was to think of a real-world problem we all face and experience in our lives too, like I used to waste hours searching for a particular error on the internet, watching dozens of videos, and ending up in frustration. So we thought of making an App where one can get personal assistance from tech experts who can help them figure out what they were doing wrong, and how they can solve the particular error with the least amount of time.  
So it was a big challenge for us to build a real-time video chat app from scratch, and we explored a lot of APIs and tools and SDK's and what not to implement that... and finally, we used Agora to implement the video chat feature.

The second challenge was to make a socket io connection as we haven't used it before, We used socket io to make a private connection btw the tutor and learner to share theirs id's to connect them over video chat.  

Then we tried adding a subscription feature using stripe JS but failed due to errors from out of the world,and then used Razorpay-payment to implement that.
